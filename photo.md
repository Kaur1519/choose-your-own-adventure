# Send a Photo

You pull out your phone and snap a picture of the staircase. Seconds later, your phone glitches and shuts off. When it restarts, the photo is gone.

A new app icon now sits on your home screen: a glowing book with no name.

You tap it. The screen goes black — then lights up with swirling symbols you don’t recognize.
Behind the photo album, you notice a small hidden door slightly ajar.
