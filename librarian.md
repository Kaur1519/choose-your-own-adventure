# Ask the Librarian

You walk quickly to the front desk, trying not to sound crazy. "Excuse me, there's… a staircase behind the shelf."

The librarian freezes. Her expression changes from pleasant to serious. "You saw it?"

She pulls out a small key and slides it into your hand. “Then it’s your turn now. I can't say more.”

You’re stunned. Before you can reply, she turns and disappears into a back room.
