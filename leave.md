# Walk Away

You slide the book back into place and step away, heart pounding. But no matter where you move in the library, you feel eyes watching you.

When you finally leave the building, your phone buzzes with a notification:  
*“You were chosen. Return.”*

You don’t know how it knows. But you can’t ignore the message for long.

Or maybe you want to explore the mysterious staircase you saw earlier instead of leaving?
