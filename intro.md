# The Portal in the Library

It was supposed to be a regular study session. You had your books, your laptop, and your favorite spot in the corner of the old town library. But today, something was different.

As you reached for a dusty volume on the top shelf, the shelf creaked and shifted, revealing a narrow, spiral staircase leading downward — one that definitely wasn’t there before.

You hesitate at the edge. A cool breeze drifts up from below. Curiosity gnaws at you.

**What will you do?**
